# Extreme solutions for cursor problems

Did everything else fail? Just want to try an extreme solution? Here are some that were too extreme to mention on the main list:

* Never let your battery drop below `x` percent (20-31% recommended as `x`)

* Never let your battery reach `y` percent (91-100% recommended as `y`)

Those are all the extreme solutions that have worked for me. [Recommend more here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Computer-cursor-tech-support/Discussions)
