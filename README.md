Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of April 25th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Computer-cursor-tech-support/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 25th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

## About

# Solving your Linux mouse cursor problems

[See Linux help](/Linux/)

This directory contains documentation and scripts to try and help you fix your frozen/malfunctioning mouse cursor (mouse pointer, or just cursor) on Linux.

**Note:** some scripts only work for certain configurations. You can find your desktop environment in `settings >> about`

## Basic troubleshooting

If it is a one time thing, you can close programs with `alt` + `f4` and you can save your files with `CTRL` + `s` (to save playlists in VLC Media Player, the shortcut is `CTRL` + `Y`) sometimes, the issue may resolve on its own after a few programs are closed. If not keep closing until you get to the desktop and see if it responds. If not, try the tricks below, or reboot your system by pressing the power button and pressing `TAB` until you get to `restart` or `shutdown` (you should NOT power down your system by holding down the power button unless the keyboard isn't responding as well, this should be a last resort)

## Common programs

### GNOME Extensions

If not already installed, GNOME Extensions give you control of desktop icons, the dock, and app indicators. Turning the first 2 off and turning them back on may fix the mouse problem.

### GNOME Tweaks

If not already installed, GNOME Tweaks offers various ways of tweaking the appearance and control of your Linux/GNOME system. 

1. Try: `General` >> `Screen animations` try turning this off. It can help sometimes, although it can make using your system a lot more bland

2. No other options currently available for this program

### Compiz

Compiz is a powerful desktop customization tool. It can unfortunately be the problem. If you have compiz installed and want to test, try:

```shell
pkill compiz
```

Be careful with this command, as it will break compiz for your current session, although it should work again after a reboot.

## Mouse reinstallation

To reinstall your mouse, try this script:

```shell
modprobe -r psmouse # for removing it
```

If you don't have permissions, add a sudo (I promise this is safe, I did it myself on my main machine):

```shell
sudo modprobe -r psmouse # for removing it
```

Then add the mouse back by using this script:

```shell
modprobe psmouse # for adding it
```

If you still don't have proper permissions, add a sudo again. Also, again, I promise that this is safe:

```shell
sudo modprobe psmouse # for adding it
```

Note: this method doesn't always work.

You can see the scripts [here](/Linux/GNOME/)

I got these examples from the [Unix stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/199631/cursor-freezes-keystrokes-to-release) @ [https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/522446](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/522446)

## If all else fails

If all else fails, a reboot might be needed. If that doesn't work, or you don't want to/can't reboot, always remember that you can use your computer without a mouse. If you have a touchscreen, you can use that to replace the mouse, but you should probably try to learn how to use your computer without your mouse and without touch input.

To open a terminal, type `ctrl` + `alt` + `tab`

To switch between programs, type `alt` + `tab` keep pressing until you get to a program you need

To submit information in a web browser, type `ctrl` + `enter`

To close a window, press `alt` + `f4` (yes, this does work on Linux, it isn't specific to Windows)

You will likely be using the `tab` and `enter` keys very frequently (tab switches to the next available button/element)

## Solving your Windows 10 mouse cursor problems

[See Windows 10 help](/Windows/Windows 10/) - Link is currently broken

This directory contains documentation and scripts to try and help you fix your frozen/malfunctioning mouse cursor (mouse pointer, or just cursor) on Windows 10

Note: this guide is incomplete. This is a heavily modified version of the Linux article, which can be seen [here](/Linux/)

## Basic troubleshooting

If it is a one time thing, you can close programs with `alt` + `f4` and you can save your files with `CTRL` + `s` (to save playlists in VLC Media Player, the shortcut is `CTRL` + `Y`) sometimes, the issue may resolve on its own after a few programs are closed. If not keep closing until you get to the desktop and see if it responds. If not, try the tricks below, or reboot your system by pressing `ALT` + `F4` on the desktop, then press `TAB` to select the dropdown, and use the up and down arrow keys until you get to `restart` or `shutdown` (unless there is an update available, then you might want or might not want to do it)

**You should NOT power down your system by holding down the power button** unless the keyboard isn't responding as well, this should be a last resort) pressing the power button will put the computer into sleep mode (with default settings) so this won't work.

## Common programs

No data to display

## Mouse reinstallation

To reinstall your mouse, try this script in the Windows terminal (normal terminal, PowerShell IDE, or your preferred terminal program)

Note: none of these scripts are available yet. Please help me write this article better.

```powershell
echo ("Data not available");
```

PERMISSION_DENIED

```powershell
echo ("Data not available");
```

Then add the mouse back by using this script:

Note: none of these scripts are available yet. Please help me write this article better.

```powershell
echo ("Data not available");
```
PERMISSION_DENIED

```powershell
echo ("Data not available");
```

Note: this method doesn't always work.

You can see the scripts [here](/Windows/Windows 10/Scripts/)

## If all else fails

If all else fails, a reboot might be needed. If that doesn't work, or you don't want to/can't reboot, always remember that you can use your computer without a mouse. If you have a touchscreen, you can use that to replace the mouse, but you should probably try to learn how to use your computer without your mouse and without touch input.

To open a terminal, press `[::] Windows` + `R`

To switch between programs, type `alt` + `tab` keep pressing until you get to a program you need

To submit information in a web browser, type `ctrl` + `enter`

To close a window, press `alt` + `f4`

You will likely be using the `tab` and `enter` keys very frequently (tab switches to the next available button/element)

# Solving your MacOS mouse cursor problems

[See MacOS help](/MacOS/)

This directory contains documentation and scripts to try and help you fix your frozen/malfunctioning mouse cursor (mouse pointer, or just cursor) on MacOS.

Applicable for: Classic Mac OS (8.0 and up) Mac OS X Server, Mac OS X 10.0 to 10.7, OS X 10.8 to 10.11, MacOS 10.12 to 10.15, 11.0 to 11.3

**Note:** some scripts only work for certain configurations. You can find your desktop environment in `settings >> about`

## Basic troubleshooting

If it is a one time thing, you can close programs with `alt` + `f4` and you can save your files with `CTRL` + `s` (to save playlists in VLC Media Player, the shortcut is `CTRL` + `Y`) sometimes, the issue may resolve on its own after a few programs are closed.

## Common programs

No data is available here.

## Mouse reinstallation

To reinstall your mouse, try this script (only tested on Linux, NOT MACOS)

```shell
modprobe -r psmouse # for removing it
```

If you don't have permissions, add a sudo

```shell
sudo modprobe -r psmouse # for removing it
```

Then add the mouse back by using this script:

```shell
modprobe psmouse # for adding it
```

If you still don't have proper permissions

```shell
sudo modprobe psmouse # for adding it
```

Note: this method doesn't always work.

# Extreme solutions for cursor problems

Did everything else fail? Just want to try an extreme solution? Here are some that were too extreme to mention on the main list:

* Never let your battery drop below `x` percent (20-31% recommended as `x`)

* Never let your battery reach `y` percent (91-100% recommended as `y`)

Those are all the extreme solutions that have worked for me. [Recommend more here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Computer-cursor-tech-support/Discussions)

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
